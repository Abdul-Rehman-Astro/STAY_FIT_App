```python
from BasicPoseModule import PoseModule

# Initialize Pose Module
pose = PoseModule()

# Main loop
while True:
    # Get frame from camera
    frame = capture_frame()
    
    # Perform pose detection
    landmarks = pose.detect_landmarks(frame)
    
    # Count push-ups and provide feedback
    push_up_count = pose.count_push_ups(landmarks)
    pose.display_feedback(frame, push_up_count)
```
